    "# Two Agents Collaborating to Solve LeWord Puzzle Game\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent AI system designed to collaboratively play and solve the LeWord puzzle game. The setup includes two specialized AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vision Agent:** Processes visual representations of the game board to understand the current game state, using rendered images of guesses and their feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word Agent:** Uses the structured game state information combined with the vision agent‚Äôs embeddings to decide the next best guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents interact through a set of tools including guessing, requesting hints, and rendering the game board image as base64. The game state is modeled using Pydantic data classes for structured and type-safe communication. This architecture showcases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-agent cooperation  \n",
    "- Use of vision models to interpret game state visually  \n",
    "- Structured data exchange with Pydantic schemas  \n",
    "- Integration of multiple tool functions for flexible AI reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook runs the game loop where the agents iteratively update their understanding and make guesses until the puzzle is solved or attempts are exhausted.\n"
